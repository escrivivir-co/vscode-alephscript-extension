- **Port Management**: Automatic port assignment and conflict resolution
- **Quick Launch**: One-click start/stop and browser opening for web-based UIs

### ðŸ“¡ Socket.io Bus Monitor
- **Real-time Message Monitoring**: Live view of all socket.io communications
- **Three-Channel Architecture**: 
  - **Application Channel**: Game logic and agent interactions
  - **System Channel**: Infrastructure and health monitoring
  - **UserInterface Channel**: UI updates and user interactions
- **Room-based Communication**: Join and monitor specific communication rooms
- **Message Filtering**: Filter messages by channel type, room, or custom criteria
- **Interactive Testing**: Send custom messages to test your system

### ðŸ”Œ MCP Server Integration
- **Multi-server Support**: Built-in support for common MCP servers:
  - State Machine Server (game state management)
  - Wiki MCP Browser (knowledge access and web browsing)
  - DevOps MCP Server (system operations)

- **Port Configuration**: Flexible port assignment with defaults for common servers

## Installation

### Development Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the folder in VS Code
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Press `F5` to launch the Extension Development Host
5. In the new VS Code window, the extension will be active

### Package Installation
1. Run `npm run compile` to build the extension
2. Run `vsce package` to create a `.vsix` file
3. Install the `.vsix` file in VS Code via Extensions > Install from VSIX

## Usage

### Getting Started
1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Type "MCP Manager" to see available commands
3. Start with "Open Config Editor" to set up your configuration file

### Available Commands
- **Open Config Editor**: Launch the visual configuration editor
- **Start Launcher**: Start the X+1 application launcher
- **Stop Launcher**: Stop the launcher process
- **Open Socket Monitor**: Monitor real-time socket.io communications
- **Manage UIs**: Control all gamification user interfaces
- **Manage MCP Servers**: Control MCP server instances

### Configuration Structure
The extension works with JSON configuration files that define:
- Application type and launcher settings
- Game definitions with agent configurations
- MCP server bindings and health settings
- UI instance definitions with ports and types
- Orchestration settings for message routing

See `sample-config.json` for a complete example configuration.

## Architecture

### Extension Components
- **ConfigEditor**: Web-based configuration management with forms
- **ProcessManager**: Lifecycle management for all system processes
- **SocketMonitor**: Real-time socket.io communication monitoring
- **UIManager**: Management of multiple gamification UI instances
- **MCPServerManager**: Health monitoring and control of MCP servers

### Communication Patterns
The extension supports a three-channel socket.io communication pattern:
- **Application**: Game logic, agent interactions, and core functionality
- **System**: Infrastructure monitoring, health checks, and system events
- **UserInterface**: UI updates, user interactions, and interface coordination

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.74.0 or higher
- Node.js 18+ for running managed processes
- Socket.io server for message monitoring
- MCP-compatible servers for full functionality

## Extension Settings

- `mcpSocketManager.configPath`: Path to your configuration file
- `mcpSocketManager.autoStart`: Automatically start services when opening workspace
